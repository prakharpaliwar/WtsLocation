Just a basic demo of project

One of the basic requirements for ORACLE Cerner applications is the need for the system to know where an access point (a terminal, PC, and so on) is physically located. This is accomplished with a database of every access point that uses Cerner, better known as the WTSLocation Database. This database contains different fields of essential information for each access point; these fields are shown and described below. This database can exist on any server that is accessible by all servers in the Citrix farm. A second database exists in a location separate from the primary location and is an exact synchronized copy of the primary. This backup database is used for data backup and failover events when the primary location becomes unusable or inaccessible for any reason.

Every time a user connects to the Citrix server, WTSLocation (WTSLocation.exe) runs in the background and imports this information (based on the computer name) from the WTSLocation database into each users' subsection of the system, for use during that session.
